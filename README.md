# Open-Hummus
For love and fuel:
Open-Hummus is started by me, Aisha.  I began making my own hummus at a pivotal moment in my life. I decided to live lean; mentally, physically and anatomically. I did this by starting a company, getting rid of most of my stuff, eating whole foods, meditating and doing yoga.  I haven't looked back.  I have had conversations with fellow thinkers and doers about hummus - yes, really! Which is what gave me the inspiration to start Open-Hummus, because making it, eating it and sharing it represents a love for life and provides the fuel to live it well. 
For now, this is a place to share your hummus recipe.  Later on, I would love to make Open-Hummus into a book.

Branch off my hummus recipe to edit and add your own recipe.  Be specific (brand etc) if you think it gives you the best result.

Things I make other than Hummus: consumer products, art and pancakes every morning!

Hummus description: After several years of hummus making, it was Ottolenghi's recipe that enlightened me.  I have now made it enough times to tweak and adjust according to my own preferences.  It's creamy, classic and plain.  I like to eat it with oatcakes or a boiled eggs and rice.

Equipment: 
Magimix Le Mini Plus (a mini food processor)

Ingredients:
250g dried chickpeas (Waitrose)
1/2 teaspoon bicarbonate soda
4 tablespoons light Tahini (Suma)
1/2 Lemon
1 garlic clove
1/2 teaspoon Sea Salt (Cornish Sea Salt Co)
4-6 tablespoons cold water
4 tablespoons extra vrigin olive oil (Iliada greek olive oil)

Method:

1. Soak chickpeas overnight in lots of water and bicarbonate of soda.  The next day rinse soaked chickpeas thoroughly and add to a pan of boiling water (lots of water). Adjust to a medium heat so that the water is gently boiling and leave a lid slightly ajar on the top of the pan. Cook until chickpeas are very tender (approx 40 minutes)

2. Add drained chickpeas to food processor with 2 tablespoons of water and blend for 5 minutes.  Stop blender to scrape down chickpeas and blend for another 5 minutes.  A lot of blending gives a really creamy end result.

3. Add juice of 1/2 a lemon, 1 crushed garlic clove and sea salt.  Blend for a couple of minutes.

4. Add 4 tablespoons of tahini and blend until smooth.

5. While the blender is on trickle in cold water 1 tablespoon of cold water at a time until you get the consitency you like.

6. Taste to check if more salt is required and add more if needed.

7. Spread the hummus into a shallow bowl and drizzle olive oil on top to serve.
