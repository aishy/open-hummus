For love and fuel: shared hummus recipes
Open Hummus is started by me, Aisha.  I began making my own hummus at a pivotal moment in my life. I decided to live lean; mentally, physically and anatomically. I did this by starting a company, getting rid of most of my stuff, eating whole foods, meditating and doing yoga.  I haven't looked back.  I have had conversations with fellow thinkers and doers about hummus - yes, really! Which is what gave me the inspiration to start Open Hummus, because making it, eating it and sharing it represents a love for life and provides the fuel to live it well. 
For now, this is a place to share your hummus recipe.  Later on, I would love to make Open Hummus into a book.
